# Git Skills Practice Repo

This repo contains a seldom-seen early version of the CDL website that is in grave need of updating.
Here are some things you can try in here to practice your skills:

- Merge dev into main, and resolve conflicts.
- Undo the merge you just made by resetting your local main to its upstream.
- Rebase dev onto main, and resolve conflicts.
- One commit on dev fixes a spelling error in the previous commit. Rebase again, and try squashing this commit into the previous one.
- See if you can modify the dev branch so that each commit only adds one name.
- Prepare a PR adding your name to the employee list.
- Prepare a PR to convert CDL branding to K+C.

Have fun!
